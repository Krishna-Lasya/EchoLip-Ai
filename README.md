# EchoLip-AI

A deep learning model for realistic lip synchronization with audio input.

## Overview

EchoLip-AI is an advanced lip-sync model that generates realistic mouth movements synchronized with input audio. The system can be used for dubbing videos, creating virtual avatars, and enhancing video production workflows.

## Features

- High-quality lip synchronization with minimal artifacts
- Support for multiple languages and accents
- Real-time inference capabilities
- Modular architecture for easy customization
- Comprehensive training pipeline
