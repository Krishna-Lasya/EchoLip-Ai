# EchoLip-Ai

Advanced Audio-Visual Lip Synchronization System

## Project Overview
EchoLip-Ai is a cutting-edge deep learning system designed to create realistic lip synchronization between audio and video. Our technology enables seamless dubbing, virtual avatars, and enhanced video production by generating natural mouth movements that perfectly match speech input.

### Key Features
- Real-time lip synchronization with minimal latency
- High-quality face preservation that maintains identity
- Cross-language support for multilingual applications
- Temporal consistency across video frames
- Modular architecture for easy customization

## Technical Approach
EchoLip-Ai uses a multi-stage pipeline:
1. **Audio Analysis**: Extract mel-spectrograms and audio features
2. **Face Detection & Landmark Extraction**: Identify facial landmarks with focus on mouth region
3. **Audio-Visual Fusion**: Correlate audio features with facial movements
4. **Lip Generation**: Create realistic lip movements synchronized with audio
5. **Face Composition**: Seamlessly blend generated lip region with original face

## Model Architecture
Our system employs multiple specialized neural networks:
- **Audio Encoder**: Conv1D + LSTM architecture for temporal audio feature extraction
- **Face Encoder**: Modified ResNet50 for facial feature extraction
- **Fusion Module**: Cross-attention mechanism to correlate audio and visual features
- **Lip Generator**: U-Net based decoder for generating realistic lip movements
- **Face Compositor**: Blending network for seamless integration

## Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate our system using:
- **Lip-Sync Distance**: Measures temporal alignment between audio and lip movements
- **Perceptual Quality**: LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR metrics
- **Identity Preservation**: Face similarity scores
- **Temporal Consistency**: Frame-to-frame smoothness
